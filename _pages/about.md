I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at KU. My primary research interests revolve around machine learning, IoT (Internet of Things), and mobile security, with a particular emphasis on cross-layer security. I possess proficiency in data analysis and machine learning, as well as expertise in Android security. I am excited to contribute to advancements in these fields and collaborate with fellow researchers in the pursuit of innovative solutions.

An experienced security researcher on cross-layer
======
During my six-year working experience at CAS, I dedicated myself to the study of hardware security. My Ph.D. journey has further honed my expertise, where I am specifically concentrating on the intricate domain of cross-layer security. This combination of practical experience and academic pursuit has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of security, bridging the gap between theory and real-world applications.

Proficiency in Python and Java
======
Throughout my Ph.D. journey, I have led three significant research projects.

My first project concentrated on elevating security measures in face recognition systems, honing my proficiency in Python and PyTorch.

The second project centered on enhancing Android app security, which further developed my skills in Java.

My third project entailed extensive data analysis, tracking the dynamic trends in ethical considerations within the security community, thereby strengthening my capabilities with Pandas.

A man who loves the natural
======
Exploring the beauty of the natural world has always been a deep-seated passion of mine. Over the years, I've been fortunate enough to embark on numerous adventures, traversing the picturesque landscapes and pristine wilderness of many national parks in both the United States and China. These journeys have not only allowed me to immerse myself in the breathtaking scenery and diverse ecosystems but have also provided me with a profound appreciation for the rich tapestry of our planet's natural wonders.

I love sports
======
I proudly consider myself a devoted basketball enthusiast, which is one of the compelling reasons why I chose to be part of the KU community. The thrill of the game, the camaraderie on the court, and the opportunity to constantly challenge and improve oneself have always held a special place in my heart.

Beyond basketball, I've also honed my skills in a variety of sports, including badminton, table tennis (PingPong), and swimming. These activities not only keep me physically active but also contribute to my holistic well-being. I find joy in the diverse world of sports and the opportunities they provide for personal growth and competition.
